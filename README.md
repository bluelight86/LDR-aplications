# LDR-aplication

This project showcases the design and implementation of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) built to demonstrate the operating principle of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The board includes two independent circuits that illustrate how light intensity can be used to control electronic components such as LEDs and buzzers.

1. Progressive LED brightness control:
   In this circuit, the LEDâ€™s brightness gradually increases as the surrounding light decreases. This behavior is achieved through the variable resistance of the LDR, which changes depending on the light level it      receives. The circuit visually represents the continuous relationship between light and resistance, making it useful for understanding basic analog sensor responses.

2. Darkness detection with buzzer alert:
  The second circuit activates an LED and a buzzer when the LDR senses darkness. It demonstrates how light sensors can be used to trigger actions in low-light conditions, similar to automatic lighting systems or      security alerts.

The PCB was designed for educational and experimental purposes, allowing students and enthusiasts to observe the interaction between sensors and simple control circuits. It can also serve as a foundation for more advanced projects involving automation, IoT, or environmental monitoring.

All schematic diagrams, PCB layout files, and documentation are included in this repository for reference and reproduction.
